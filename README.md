## Description

This project produced a Progressive Web App `PWA` that allows users to create notes or code snippets with JavaScript syntax highlighting, with or without an internet connection and can reliably retrieve them for later use.
By completing this project I was able to demonstrate `PWA` principals I learned in bootcamp coding class.
